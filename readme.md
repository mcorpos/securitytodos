# Security TODOs

> Helping you get organized with home computer security tasks

## Origin

Matt wanted a better way of sharing and organizing home computer security tasks,
 something easier to digest and follow through with than a long detailed email.
The [TodoMVC team](http://todomvc.com) offered a great starting point with a
client-only TODO app with AngularJS.

## TODO App

To read more about the underlying TODO app (from the TodoMVC team) and
AngularJS, refer to the [README](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/examples/angularjs/readme.md)
for the AngularJS example under the TodoMVC project.

## Testsuite

The app uses [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) to run the tests located in the `test/` folder. To run the tests:

```
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

## Disclaimer

I am new to GitHub and the technologies used in the app ... bear with me.
