# Security TODOs

> Helping you get organized with home computer security tasks

## Origin
Matt wanted a better way of sharing and organizing home computer security tasks
- something easier to digest and follow through with than a long detailed email.
The [TodoMVC team](http://todomvc.com) offered a great starting point with a
client-only TODO app with AngularJS.
